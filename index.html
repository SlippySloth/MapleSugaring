			<h2>
				What is maple sugaring?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Maple sugaring is the practice of collecting sap from a maple tree, 
				and boiling off most of the water until you are left with a sweet, 
				delicious syrup. There's nothing quite like the taste of that first 
				drop of maple syrup after a season of sugaring. 

			</p>
			<h2>
				Sugar content of maple syrup
			</h2>
			<p>
				Proper maple syrup has a final sugar content of 66-67%. If the sugar 
				content is lower (more water), it has a higher tendency to mold. If 
				the sugar content is higher (less water), then the syrup has a tendency 
				to crystallize. That said, if you're final syrup is too thick or too thin, 
				you will still have a tasty product. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Best trees to tap
			</h2>
			<p>
				Many species of maple trees can be tapped for sap. Sugar maples are most 
				commonly used because the raw sap typically has 2% sugar content. However, 
				this can vary widely according to that season's weather, the soil the tree 
				grows in, and other factors. Other trees can be tapped, but will need 
				to be boiled longer. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Maple sugaring season
			</h2>
			<p>
				Maple sugaring season happens when the days are above freezing and nights 
				are below freezing. This is due to pressure. When temperatures get warmer, 
				it creates positive pressure in the tree, which expels the sap out of any 
				holes in the tree. When temperatures go below freezing, it creates negative 
				pressure in the tree, drawing water up from the roots. This replenishes the 
				supply of sap in the tree so there's more sap to flow tomorrow.
